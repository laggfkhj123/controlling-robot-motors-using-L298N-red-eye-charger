Charger
This is a circuit design for charging LIPO battery
The Input will be 220 v with 60 frequency ac, so I designed the circuit to give output 11.1v -same battery- and 220mA. why I chose 220mA? because, to charge the battery you need to supply it by 10% current of its capacity, so 10% of 2200mAh is 220mA

Implementation Steps
Transformer, to transform 220v to 11.1 v.
Two diode, to build a full-wave rectifier.
Capacitor, to modify the wave to be a dc wave.
Two resistors, to adjust both current and voltage.
